          <article>
            <p>
              If we talk in simpler terms, Cyber security is that part which
              helps business and organization form electronic threats.
              Electronic threats can be defensive devices, hackers, and
              machines. The Cyber security of today, works on defending
              computers, networks, databases, and smartphones from the threat.
              No one notices the hard work of these cyber security
              professionals. They protect you from unauthorized exploitation of
              your systems.
            </p>

              Next up, this cyber security for beginners tutorial will help you understand some of the terminologies you must be familiar with before learning anything about cybersecurity. 
            </p>  
            <ol>
              <li>Network
                <p>A network is a connection between two or more computers so that they can communicate with each other.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Internet
                <p>Internet is a means of connecting a computer to any other computer anywhere in the world via dedicated routers and servers.</p>
              </li>
              <li>Internet Protocol
                <p>The data that is transferred or received cannot follow any path. There are a set of rules that are followed to control the flow of the internet. These rules are called internet protocol.</p>
              </li>
              <li>IP Address
                <p>An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is an address assigned to all devices that connect to a computer network and uses the Internet Protocol for communication. An IP address looks like this: 168.192.10.3</p>
              </li>
              <li>Domain Name Server(DNS)
                <p>Consider DNS as the phonebook of the internet. All the IP addresses and the name of the links are saved in it. For example, you want to go to google.com. You type this on your web application. Then, this name goes to the DNS server, and the DNS server finds the IP address of google.com. Then, the DNS server returns it to your computer with the IP address.</p>

              The security of any organization starts with three principles: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability. And next in this cyber security for beginners tutorial we will learn about the CIA Triad, which has served as the industry standard for computer security since the time of first mainframes.

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: The principles of confidentiality assert that only authorized parties can access sensitive information and functions. Example: military secrets.</li>
              <li><strong>Integrity</strong>: The principles of integrity assert that only authorized people and means can alter, add, or remove sensitive information and functions. Example: a user entering incorrect data into the database.</li>
              <li><strong>Availability</strong>: The principles of availability assert that systems, functions, and data must be available on-demand according to agreed-upon parameters based on levels of service.</li>

          <article>
            <p>
              The term ‘Hacker’ was coined to describe experts who used their skills to re-develop mainframe systems, increasing their efficiency and allowing them to multi-task. Nowadays, the term routinely describes skilled programmers who gain unauthorized access into computer systems by exploiting weaknesses or using bugs, motivated either by malice or mischief. For example, a hacker can create algorithms to crack passwords, penetrate networks, or even disrupt network services.

        <section class="main-section" id="Pentest">
          <h1>Penetration Testing</h1>
          <article>
            <p>
              A penetration test, also known as a pen test, is a simulated cyber attack against your computer system to check for exploitable vulnerabilities. In the context of web application security, penetration testing is commonly used to augment a web application firewall (WAF).
            </p>
            <p>
              Pen testing can involve the attempted breaching of any number of application systems, (e.g., application protocol interfaces (APIs), frontend/backend servers) to uncover vulnerabilities, such as unsanitized inputs that are susceptible to code injection attacks.
            </p>
            <h3>Pentesting Stages</h3>
            <p>
              The pen testing process can be broken down into five stages.</br>
              <ol>
                <li>Planning and reconnaissance
                  <p>The first stage involves:</br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Defining the scope and goals of a test, including the systems to be addressed and the testing methods to be used.</li>
                      <li>Gathering intelligence (e.g., network and domain names, mail server) to better understand how a target works and its potential vulnerabilities.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>Scanning
                  <p>The next step is to understand how the target application will respond to various intrusion attempts. This is typically done using:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Static analysis – Inspecting an application’s code to estimate the way it behaves while running. These tools can scan the entirety of the code in a single pass.</li>
                      <li>Dynamic analysis – Inspecting an application’s code in a running state. This is a more practical way of scanning, as it provides a real-time view into an application’s performance.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                </li>
                <li>Gaining Access
                  <p>This stage uses web application attacks, such as cross-site scripting, SQL injection and backdoors, to uncover a target’s vulnerabilities. Testers then try and exploit these vulnerabilities, typically by escalating privileges, stealing data, intercepting traffic, etc., to understand the damage they can cause.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Maintaining access 
                  <p>The goal of this stage is to see if the vulnerability can be used to achieve a persistent presence in the exploited system— long enough for a bad actor to gain in-depth access. The idea is to imitate advanced persistent threats, which often remain in a system for months in order to steal an organization’s most sensitive data.</p>
                </li>
              </ol>
